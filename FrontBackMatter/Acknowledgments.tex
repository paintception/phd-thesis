\begin{flushright}{\slshape    
Either way, we're not alone \\ 
I'll find a new place to be from \\ 
A haunted house with a picket fence \\
To float around and ghost my friends \\
No, I'm not afraid to disappear \\
The billboard said, "The end is near" \\ 
I turned around, there was nothing there \\ 
\textbf{Yeah, I guess the end is here}
