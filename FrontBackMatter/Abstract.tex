\chapter*{Abstract}

The ability of linking novel, potentially problematic situations to events that we have already observed in our past is at the center of human intelligence. Throughout our lifetime we constantly need to deal with unforeseen events, which sometimes can be so overwhelming to look insurmountable. A common strategy that humans as well as animals have learned to adopt throughout millions of years of evolution, is to start tackling novel, unseen situations by re-using knowledge that in the past resulted in successfull solutions. Being able of recognizing patterns across similar settings, as well as the capacity of re-using and potentially adapting an already established skill set, is . 

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to create computer programs, typically built on top of mathematical models, that are able of mimicking, . It follows that among such abilities, there is also that of being capable of adapting to new unseen situations and to potentially learn how to solve new tasks whilst exploiting some previously acquired knowledge. This capacity comes with the name of Transfer Learning.
