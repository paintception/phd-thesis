\caption{An overview of the two datasets that are used in our experiments. Each color of the table corresponds to a different classification challenge, starting from challenge $1$ which is represented in yellow, challenge $2$ in blue and finally challenge $3$ in red. 
Furthermore we represent with $N_t$ the amount of samples constituting the datasets and with $Q_t$ the number of labels. Lastly, we also report if there are common labels between the two heritage collections.}
