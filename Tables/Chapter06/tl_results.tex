\caption{The results comparing the performance that is obtained on the testing-set by the best pruned model winner of the LTH, and an unpruned architecture trained from scratch. The overall best performing model is reported in a green cell, while the second best one in a yellow cell. We can observe that pruned models winners of the LTH perform significantly better than a larger over-parametrized architecture that gets trained from scratch. As can be seen by the results obtained on the \texttt{Mouse-LBA} and \texttt{Artist} 1 datasets the difference in terms of performance can be particularly large ($\approx 20\%$).}
