\caption{Some additional information about the lottery winners which performance is reported in Table \ref{tab:results}. For each winning ticket we report the fraction of weights that is pruned from an original ResNet-50 architecture and that therefore characterizes the level of sparsity of the overall best performing lottery ticket. The results in the Scratch-Training column are not reported as these are unpruned models that are trained from scratch.}
