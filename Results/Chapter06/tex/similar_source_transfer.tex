    \caption{Our results showing the benefits of transferring lottery winners that have been identified on a related source task. We can observe that on the \texttt{Mouse-LBA} dataset, winning tickets that were obtained on the \texttt{Human-LBA} dataset are the ones that are the most robust ones to pruning, while on the \texttt{Artist} 2 dataset we can observe that lottery winners that have been obtained on the \texttt{Artist} 1 dataset are both more robust to pruning, while they also yield overall better performance.}
